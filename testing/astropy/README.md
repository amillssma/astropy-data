Old notes
---------

This directory contains reference images for the image tests in Astropy. At
the top level is one directory per UTC time when the images were added. This
is less confusing than using commit hashes because it allows the images to be
easily explored chronologically. Inside each directory is then one directory
per group of matplotlib versions (that is, when matplotlib introduces
backwards-incompatible changes, we provide a new set of reference images).
